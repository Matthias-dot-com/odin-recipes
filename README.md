# Odin Recipes

## Introduction

Welcome to my first project with The Odin Project! This repository contains a simple HTML website that showcases my foundational skills in HTML, Git, and GitHub. As I embark on this journey of web development, I'm excited to build this website from scratch and share my learning experience.

## Project Overview

`odin-recipes` is more than just a collection of recipes; it's a testament to the progress I'm making in my coding journey. Through this project, I aim to demonstrate:

- **Basic HTML structure**: Crafting well-organized HTML documents with proper tagging.
- **Use of Git**: Version control and tracking changes in my code.
- **GitHub proficiency**: Managing my repository and sharing my work with the world.

## Learning Outcomes

By the end of this project, I will have achieved the following milestones:

- A clear understanding of HTML elements and their proper usage.
- The ability to create and manage a Git repository.
- The skill to commit changes and push my work to GitHub for public visibility.

## Conclusion

This project is just the beginning of what I hope to be a fulfilling and challenging adventure in web development. I look forward to refining my skills and building more complex projects in the future.

Thank you for visiting my `odin-recipes` project. Any feedback or contributions are greatly appreciated as I continue to learn and grow in this field.
